## **Conflict Plan**
- **How do we resolve conflicts:**
  - Take it to a vote and a group discussion.If the team can not unanimously vote, then the PM will be the deciding vote, while still factoring in the team’s opinion.In the event of a conflict requiring a vote, we agree it is better to have it written down. And some options of resolving it is providing pros and cons.
- **What do we do if someone is taking over the project:**
  - Team discussions and decide together what tasks are assigned to each individual.
- **How do we account for differences in knowledge:**
  - We help each other, patience and guidance are the best way to improve not only yourself but others as well.
- **How do we address lazy people:**
  - Team discussion, call their slacking out. And one way to do this tactfully is to each day ask each person their goals for the day, and ask if they have any hurdles in their work, and how we can help them.
- **When do we report the lazies:**
  - We will try to solve everything to the best of our ability, but if a team member has not contributed to their assigned tasks after 2 days we will need to escalate it to the instructional team.
